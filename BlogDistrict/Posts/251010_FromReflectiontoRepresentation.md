# 🏛️ From Reflection to Representation: Why Our Mayor Outlawed obj Probing
In the early days of FunctionaL City, we inherited a legacy ordinance: a design that relied on obj casting and reflection to inspect our citizens. It was expedient—but not lawful. Payloads were cast into anonymity, provenance was lost, and remixers were forced to guess at runtime.

The Problem: Intrusive Probing of Anonymous Citizens
This previous [commit](https://github.com/flideros/FunctionL-City/blob/88368353f82585342e3aa3cb4a0d610f11836488/CivicAlgebraicInfrastructure/Foundations/Primitives.fs) introduced a reflection-based dispatcher that operated like a surveillance drone:

```fsharp
let inspect (x: obj) =
    let t = x.GetType()
    // probe properties, cast values, hope for the best...
```

This design violated our civic charter:
* Citizens were stripped of their type identity.
* Remixers had no guarantees—only runtime exceptions.
* Provenance was untraceable, and nulls roamed freely.

## 🧑‍⚖️ The Mayor’s Ruling: Types Are Citizens
After laying out the scaffolding for the CivicSet, I quickly realized that implementing a way to represent the union of two sets would require a way to join two or more different types. This called for a union type that could represent two different types `Lifted<'A,'B>`. I submitted a preliminary design to the City Council.

The city mayor issued a formal rejection:

>“All citizens must be types to be considered first-class citizens. Intrusive probing of our citizens should be outlawed in favor of civic citizenship.”

This declaration redefined our infrastructure:
* No more obj: all payloads must be typed.
* No more reflection: all dispatch must be lawful and narratable.
* No more nulls: all payloads must be lifted and guaranteed.

Back to the drawing board. Get some Rock Star's and coffee brewing...it going to be a long night.

## 🏗️ The New Civic Infrastructure: Lifted<'A,'B>
Our initial design allowed the discriminated union of two generic types `'A` and `'B`. But remixers quickly discovered a recursive trap: either generic type could nest another `Lifted<'A,'B>`, requiring reflection to inspect nested payloads. This violated our ordinance against runtime guessing.

The solution, replace reflection with a narratable union that included an explicit nested type:
```fsharp
type Lifted<'A,'B> =
    | A of LiftedCell<'A>
    | B of LiftedCell<'B>
    | Nested of LiftedCell<Lifted<'A,'B>>
```
But first, we needed a way to attach provenance to each lifted type. For this the record `LiftedCell<'T>` was created:
```fsharp
/// Cell that always carries a payload and optional provenance
type LiftedCell<'T> = { Value: 'T; Provenance: Provenance option }
```
Every payload is:
* Typed: remixers know exactly what they’re handling.
* Provenanced: every type carries its lineage.
* Remix-safe: no nulls, no guessing, no runtime traps.

## 🛠️ Civic Signage: Traversal Without Surveillance
Instead of probing, we now traverse with signage:

```fsharp
mapA (fun x -> x.ToUpper()) lifted  // Transform A payloads with civic clarity
collectProvenance lifted            // Trace lineage without surveillance
fold handleA handleB initial lifted // Dispatch lawfully across citizens
```
These helpers are civic-native. They empower remixers to inspect, transform, and narrate without violating the rights of their citizens.
## 🏁 Legacy Stewardship
This transition wasn’t just technical—it was civic. We moved from runtime guessing to type-driven citizenship. From surveillance to stewardship. From `obj` to ordinance.
The mayor’s veto wasn’t a rejection of progress—it was a call to lawful infrastructure.
